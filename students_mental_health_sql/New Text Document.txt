-- In this project, whether international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population, and whether social connectedness (belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with joining a new culture) are predictive of depression.
-- We will explore the students data using PostgreSQL to see if the length of stay is a contributing factor.
